Hi!

I'm Adrien Martineau, web and mobile developer using mostly Node.js, PHP, Angular and Ionic. I participate in projects and libraries alone or in a group in theses languages / frameworks.

### ðŸ“‹ My projects

- [BooksMemory](https://github.com/InnovA2/booksmemory) : Web service using NestJS and Symfony (for the web scraper), which allows to developers to retrieve information about books by search or directly by ISBN.
- [MyBooksMemory](https://github.com/InnovA2/mybooksmemory) : Mobile app using NestJS, Ionic, Angular and Symfony (for the web scraper), which allows to user to manage owned books and discover new books. Also, the application allows to know the bookstores around the user.

- ~~Heroes-Team~~ : Web app using Lightwork-API and AngularJS, which help recruitment in Heroes of the Storm with an algorithm of proposition. There was also a Discord BOT nammed "Heroes-Team-BOT" using Node.js with Discord.js. *[No longer maintained]*
- ~~Pharmapp~~ : Mobile app using Express, Ionic and Angular, which allows to users to make an appointment with a practitioner (including Google Maps) *[No longer maintained]*

> **Note:** The **Heroes-Team** project counted more than 500 users but the bad choices of the game's teams caused it to quickly lose popularity, which impacted my site. That's why I decided to stop it, for lack of activity.
